Resume
======

All source is in one file: chris_clark.tex, which uses the `article`
documentclass. Although people have attempted to make 'resume' document classes,
I found those to be rather constricting and overly complex. It's pretty
straightforward to simply use the `article` documentclass.

How to compile
--------------

`pdflatex chris_clark.tex`
