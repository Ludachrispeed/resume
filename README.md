Résumé
======

All source is in one file: `chris_clark.tex`, which uses the `article` documentclass. Although
people have attempted to make 'resume' document classes, I found those to be rather constricting and
overly complex. It's pretty straightforward to simply use the `article` documentclass.

How to compile
--------------

`pdflatex chris_clark.tex`

On Ubuntu, compilation requires the `texlive` and `texlive-latex-extra` packages to be installed.

Feedback
--------

Please feel free to open an issue, even if it's just a comment or suggestion. I always love
discussing how to design things better.
