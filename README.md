Chris's Resume
==============

This is my entirely unfinished resume, typeset with LaTeX. 

All source is in one file: chris_clark.tex, which uses the 'article'
documentclass. Although people have attempted to make 'resume' document classes,
I found those to be too constricting and overly complex. As it turns out, it's
pretty straightforward to simply use the 'article' documentclass.


How to compile
--------------

`pdflatex chris_clark.tex`
